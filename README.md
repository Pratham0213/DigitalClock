# DigitalClock
A simple digital clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This repository contains the code for a responsive and stylish digital clock that updates every second. It's a beginner-friendly project for anyone looking to practice their front-end web development skills. Feel free to use and customize this clock for your projects!
This project was a part of my SUMMER Training under Javascript for webdevelopers.
